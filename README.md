PNG Switch and QuickLauncher ID

This batch application will allow easy editting of the file "whatsnew.xml" and swapping PNGs without having to manually rename them.
PNG Switch
Simply delete the PNG app# you want to replace and run the "z-png-switch.bat" file. New PNG will be renamed accordingly.

All PNGs need to be 282 x 108. If you would like to title it, I've placed a Pixlr X file in the data folder for easy customization.
